# Overview
This application is meant to give small businesses a free option for tracking customers and inventory. It is created using Blazor WASM for the front end and Supabase to handle the database and back end. 

I bit off more than I could chew with this project. It was originally intended to be a group project and my naive mind thought I would be able to handle the whole project on my own. This was a great reminder in the importance of a software development team and collaboration.

# Future Work

- A lot
- Need to fix styles to be more aethetically pleasing
- Currently, the application connects to Supabase but am unable to populate the application with the data. 
- Able to create a 'Sales' so that the user can move product from inventory table to sales table
